# JavaScript

JavaScript was introduced in 1995 as a way to add programs to web pages
in the Netscape Navigator browser. The language has since been adopted
by all other major graphical web browsers as a tool for adding various
forms of interactivity and cleverness.

It is important to note that JavaScript has almost nothing to do with
the programming language named Java. The similar name was inspired by
marketing considerations rather than good judgment. When JavaScript was
being introduced, the Java language was being heavily marketed and was
gaining popularity. Someone thought it was a good idea to try to ride
along on this success. Now we are stuck with the name.

After its adoption outside of Netscape, a standard document was written
to describe the way the JavaScript language should work so that the
various pieces of software that claimed to support JavaScript could make
sure they actually provided the same language. This is called the
ECMAScript standard, after the Ecma International organization that
conducted the standardization. In practice, the terms ECMAScript and
JavaScript can be used interchangeably â€” they are two names for the same
language.
