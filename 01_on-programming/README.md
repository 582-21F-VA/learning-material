Programming is the act of constructing a program; a set of precise
instructions telling a computer what to do. Most programming is done
with programming languages. A programming language is an artificially
constructed language used to instruct computers. It is interesting that
the most effective way we've found to communicate with a computer
borrows so heavily from the way we communicate with each other. Like
human languages, computer languages allow words and phrases to be
combined in new ways, making it possible to express ever new concepts.

Programming, it turns out, is hard. The fundamental rules are simple and
clear, but programs built on top of these rules tend to become complex
enough to introduce their own rules and complexity. You're building your
own maze, in a way, and you can easily get lost in it.

The skill of programming is the skill of building programs that don't
confuse programmers. The best programs are those that manage to do
something interesting while still being easy to understand.
